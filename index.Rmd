Another example comes from the work of Judy DeLoache and colleagues on some children's surprising errors of spatial scale. DeLoache and colleagues observed that children sometimes tried to sit on tiny doll-sized chairs or insert themselves into tiny doll-sized cars after playing and interacting with full-sized chairs or toys.

When they submitted the paper to Science, the editors didn't believe them.

## ...a paper in *Science*

## Video...

- Captures (& preserves)
- Shows (& helps tell...)
- Expands the scope of inquiry (e.g., words +)
- Provides unparalleled opportunities for reuse

<div class="notes">
Video captures and preserves aspects of behavior that other measures often neglect; it shows what participants do and helps tell the story; it expands the scope of inquiry to include other behaviors; and it provides unparalleled opportunities for reuse.

Video also has unique strengths as research documentation.

## Shared video & audio recordings

<div class="notes">
</div>

---

- Make research more transparent
- Bolster the reproducibility of procedures
- Accelerate the adoption of new research techniques

---

- Strengthen findings
- Maximize the return on public investments in research

# Sharing video ethically & openly

## Video must be protected

<div class="notes">
Sharing video ethically requires protections.
</div>

---

- Faces, voices
- Home interiors
- Behaviors that may embarrass participants

<div class="notes">
Video is potentially identifiable. It contains faces and voices. It might contain images of home interiors or capture behaviors that could embarrass participants.
</div>

## Open sharing advances discovery

<div class="notes">
At the same time, open sharing, with limited restrictions on appropriate uses, promises to advance discovery.

How do we strike a balance between the two?
</div>

---

- Citation expected, but 
- No requirement for co-authorship
- No pre-approval of research questions

<div class="notes">
Databrary does not pre-approve research questions nor enforce requirements for co-authorship, but we expect that any researcher using our materials to cite the source.
</div>

---

<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/images/logo/databrary-nav.svg" height=250px>

## Requires...

- researchers secure participant permission to share
- IRB/ethics board approval to share
- institutional approval for access

<div class="notes">
Moreover, Databrary requires researchers to secure permission from research participants in order to share their video or audio data. Databrary requires researchers seek ethics board approvals as required by a researcher's institution. And most importantly, Databrary restricts access to researchers who have been authorized by their institutions to access the site.
</div>

## Permission to share

- Standard language via [templates](https://www.databrary.org/resources/templates.html)
- When to ask & how decided by local ethics boards/IRBs
- Sample [scripts](https://www.databrary.org/resources/guide/investigators/release/asking/script.html) and [videos](https://www.databrary.org/resources/guide/investigators/release/asking/examples.html)

<div class="notes">
Databrary has developed standard language for seeking permission to share and provides guidance about when and how to seek ethics board approval. We share sample scripts for talking with participants alongside video exemplars. 

Some researchers might be uncertain about how to ask parents or participants for permission to share video or audio, so Databrary includes videos that show how easy it is.

write_video_clip_html('https://www.databrary.org/video/example-video-1.mp4', vid_h_pix = 600, vid_w_pix = 800, show_link = FALSE)
```

<div class="notes">
</div>

## Restricting access

- Researchers at institutions
- Formalized by an [institutional agreement](https://www.databrary.org/resources/agreement.html)
- Protects participants, researchers, & institutions

<div class="notes">
Only researchers whose institutions have granted explicit access are permitted to share data. Student or staff affiliates an authorized researcher supervises may download or resuse Databrary materials if granted access by their supervisor. A researcher's institution must sign a formal institutional agreement with NYU, Databrary's host institution, before a researcher gains full access.

This policy framework protects participants, researchers, and institutions.
</div>

## Standardized [levels of sharing](https://www.databrary.org/resources/guide/investigators/release/release-levels.html)

<div class="notes">
Databrary has standardized the levels of sharing into categories; every file on the site is tagged with the level of sharing permitted.
</div>

# Accelerating discovery

## Need

- Annotation tools
- More (bigger, denser, diverse) data
- Platforms for discovery

<div class="notes">
To exploit the power of video to accelerate discovery in behavioral science, we need annotation tools, bigger data, and software tools that go beyond passive data storage but are truly platforms for discovery.
